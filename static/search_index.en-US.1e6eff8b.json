It\nalso serves the purpose of evaluation and even distribution of tea flavor.\n\nWhen brewing tea, it's inevitable that the tea isn't always drunk immediately.\nIf it continues to steep in the teapot, the tea liquid will become too strong\nand bitter. To maintain the tea liquid at its most suitable and sweetest state,\nit should be poured into another vessel after brewing. Thus, the Gongdao Cup\ncame into being.\n\nThe Gongdao Cup not only prevents over-steeping, but also has the function of\nharmonizing the strength of the tea. If the taste of different brews is too\nstrong or too weak, it can be adjusted to achieve the most suitable strength and\ntaste.\n\nIn addition, the Gongdao Cup can evenly distribute the tea liquid to multiple\nguests, allowing each guest to taste the same quality of tea.\n\nThis is the origin of the names Gongdao Cup and Fairness Cup.","routePath":"/news/gong-dao-bei","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":4,"title":"How to Identify Ancient Arbor Pu-erh Tea?","content":"#\n\nIt is undeniable that ancient arbor tea is a trend in the Pu-erh tea market.\nMany people identify ancient arbor tea by looking at the size and thickness of\nthe leaf base, assuming that large and thick leaves are ancient arbor tea. In\nfact, this is not objective.\n\nThe large and thick leaves of Pu-erh tea are not necessarily related to whether\nit is ancient arbor tea, but rather to the tea variety. Tea trees have\nlarge-leaf and small-leaf varieties, as well as thick-leaf and thin-leaf types.\nYou cannot distinguish them solely based on appearance.\n\nThe \"Six Tastes and Two Natures Tea Identification Method\" identifies the tea's\ninternal qualities. As long as you choose a tea with internal qualities, you\nwill definitely choose ancient arbor tea, because only arbor-type ancient arbor\ntea can have rich internal qualities.\n\nThis method is divided into two parts:\n\n 1. The difference in tea tree growth methods and environment.\n 2. Using the performance of the taste to identify the inclusions of the tea.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. Aroma: One of the most important keys to identification. Ancient arbor tea\n    can obtain deep-soil mineral components and can embody the uniqueness of\n    each mountain top in the best state of rich internal quality, such as the\n    honey aroma and delicate, smooth soup of Yiwu, and the fruity, dense aroma\n    of Nannuo Mountain, with a perfect tea nature that combines strength and\n    softness. The choice of aroma should be a rich and lasting aroma, with a\n    unique aroma, and a stable aroma. The more stable the aroma, the more\n    internal quality, the older the tree.\n 2. Sweetness: This sweetness refers to the direct performance on the tongue\n    after entering the mouth. Do not confuse it with hui gan (returning\n    sweetness), but its sweetness is elegant and clear, often covered by the hui\n    gan. After drinking tea for a certain number of years, you can separate and\n    taste various flavors. New tea drinkers can hardly taste it. Sweetness is\n    also a good place to identify the quality of the tea, but it is not key.\n 3. Tea Soup: Tea soup is the second key to identifying the richness of internal\n    quality. Terrace tea has insufficient internal quality in the tea soup, so\n    it appears yellow-green. The tea soup is thin as water, and it will feel hot\n    in your mouth. You can try this carefully. Ancient arbor tea is full of\n    internal quality. With the same heat, the feeling of burning your mouth is\n    different.\n 4. Hui Gan (Returning Sweetness) and Salivation: Hui Gan and salivation are the\n    basic tastes of tea. Terrace tea shows hui gan and salivation relatively\n    quickly, but the persistence is poor, and it usually starts to weaken after\n    6 infusions. Ancient arbor tea is more stable and lasting.\n 5. Bitterness and Astringency: Bitterness and astringency are also key to\n    identifying the quality of tea. Bitterness and astringency are the nature of\n    tea, derived from catechins in the tea. They are necessary elements\n    contained in every tea. The different proportions of ingredients and\n    tea-making processes create different tea soup flavors, and the bitterness\n    and astringency of Pu-erh tea basically weaken or disappear after long-term\n    storage.\n 6. Throat Feel: Throat feel is also the third key to identifying the quality of\n    tea. The throat feel is a cool and comfortable feeling formed in the throat.\n    This feeling will make your breathing particularly smooth and comfortable,\n    and it will also form a feeling of hui gan and salivation in the throat, and\n    the aroma will last for a long time. Moreover, this charm will be brought\n    into the mouth with breathing. The longer the throat feel lasts, the more\n    internal quality there is.\n 7. Persistence: Simply put, it refers to the brew endurance of the tea. Brew\n    with boiling water, pour out the soup after 10 seconds for each brew. The\n    taste of the tea changes with the increase in the number of brews. Terrace\n    tea of Yunnan Pu-erh generally starts to weaken after 6 brews, while ancient\n    arbor tea of Pu-erh can last for more than 8-10 brews, and high-quality tea\n    can last for more than 12 brews.\n 8. Stability: The stability of the tea can be obtained through the\n    identification of persistence. The higher the stability of the tea, the more\n    it can prove that the internal quality content of the tea is particularly\n    rich. In the later stage of tea storage, the effect of later aging can be\n    stably obtained, and Pu-erh tea with excellent quality can be stored.\n\nThese methods are a comprehensive summary of the experience of the industry and\nmost people and are for reference only. After all, there are too many factors\nsuch as the variety, origin, and storage of Pu-erh tea, and there is no absolute\nstandard.","routePath":"/news/how-to-identify-ancient-puerh-tee","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":5,"title":"NEWS","content":"#\n\n * The Gongdao Cup\n * How to Identify Ancient Arbor Pu-erh Tea?","routePath":"/news/","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":6,"title":"Dragon Pearl Tea (龙珠茶)","content":"#\n\nSavor 2020 Spring Gua Feng Zhai Dragon Pearl Ancient Tree Puerh raw Tea, where\nwhispers of distant mountains and clear streams unfold in every sip~\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n📮 CONTACT US TO CLAIM THESE TREASURES.","routePath":"/tea/dragon-pearl","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":7,"title":"","content":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n📮 CONTACT US TO CLAIM THESE TREASURES.","routePath":"/tea/","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":8,"title":"Raw tea (生茶)","content":"#\n\n山高远兮，有佳木。 佳木难求兮，跋涉苦。 风萧萧兮，林木撼。 槚木香远兮，秀于林。 吾当采撷兮，制清茗。 饮之如饴兮，馈君存。\n\n🫖🍃🍵 This is a raw Puerh tea from ancient trees deep in the mountains, aged\n700-800 years, playfully called ”millennium ancient trees,“\n\nPuerh tea lovers worldwide, we offer you our 2025 spring tea and 2020 mid-term\ntea to savor the beauty of aging and transformation, tasting the charm bestowed\nby time.\n\nA poem says: High mountains, with beautiful trees, Hard to find, through steep\npaths we go.
