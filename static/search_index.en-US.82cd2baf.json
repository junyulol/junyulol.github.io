Rooted in the Tang-Song legacy of masters like Mi Fu and Xia Gui,\nxieyi eschews meticulous detail for bold, expressive strokes: wet ink bleeds\ninto misty gradients, dry-brush scratches evoke rugged textures, and vast white\nvoids (fubai) invite the viewer's soul to wander, embodying the philosophy of\n\"less is more.\" It's an art of breath and pause, where mountains aren't\nconquered but conversed with, rivers not mapped but felt, fostering a meditative\nescape from the mundane—a \"quiet world\" of introspection amid life's tempests.\nProfessor Yang Junyu, with his improvisational genius, channels this essence\ninto landscapes that pulse with serene vitality, turning rice paper into portals\nof timeless wonder.Behold Yang's latest trio of masterpieces, each a spontaneous\nburst from his on-site creations, shared via evocative X posts that blend\nartistry with the raw thrill of the moment. These works, framed against Yunnan's\nmisty horizons, exemplify xieyi's liberating ethos: freedom in the flourish,\ndepth in the dissolve.Golden Valley Reverie\n\nEnveloped in a luminous ochre haze that mimics dawn's tender embrace, this\npanoramic vista unfolds like a whispered haiku—towering basalt cliffs plunge\ninto a sinuous river's amber curve, their flanks sheathed in emerald veils of\nfoliage and sapphire shadows. At the heart, a humble white-roofed pavilion\nperches on the water's edge, red-tiled accents glowing like embers of human\nwarmth amid nature's grandeur. Yang's genius lies in the subtle alchemy: layered\nwashes of diluted indigo bleed into sun-kissed golds, evoking the Daoist flux of\nyin and yang—stability in the stone, fluidity in the flow. Here, xieyi's spirit\nsoars: sparse calligraphy (\"Mountains embrace the river's song\") anchors the\ncomposition, while boundless whites breathe infinite possibility, urging us to\nlinger in prosperity's quiet lap. A talisman for the weary soul, it reminds us\nthat true wealth blooms in solitude's glow.Cascade of Celestial Descent\n\nFrom obsidian crags that claw the heavens, a silvery torrent cascades in defiant\ngrace—veils of mist unfurling like silk scarves tossed by mountain winds,\npooling into tranquil eddies where ancient cypresses stand sentinel. An arched\npavilion, etched in fluid side-strokes, bridges the chaos: a Zen perch where\nwater's roar softens to a meditative murmur. Yang wields his brush with\naudacious restraint—bold center-tip lines carve the falls' kinetic arc, while\nfeathery dry-brush fades dissolve edges into ether, capturing xieyi's core: the\n\"vital rhythm\" (qiyun shengdong) that animates the inanimate. Inscribed with\nrhythmic verse (\"Waterfalls whisper secrets to the pines\"), it seals a\nphilosophy of release—letting go, as in Daoist flow, to find renewal in the\nrush. This piece isn't static; it's alive, a sonic symphony in silence, perfect\nfor evoking inner peace in a cluttered world.Misty Pavilion Harmony\n\nEchoing the cascade's wild heart yet tempered with golden restraint, this vista\ncradles a pavilion amid terraced cliffs, where russet peaks frame a hidden gorge\nalive with emerald whispers and cerulean gleams. Sunlight filters through fog\nlike veiled lanterns, illuminating stone steps that wind toward enlightenment's\nedge. Yang's xieyi mastery shines in the interplay: vigorous forearm sweeps\nbirth the mountains' jagged spines, softened by wet-on-dry bleeds that mimic\nbreath's ebb—raw energy yielding to contemplative hush. The sparse human touch—a\nlone bridge, a fleeting path—mirrors xieyi's humility: nature as teacher, artist\nas humble scribe. With its poetic seal (\"Pavilions dwell in mist's eternal\ndream\"), it embodies the style's soul-stirring invitation: step into the void,\nand let imagination forge the path.These landscapes aren't mere adornments;\nthey're elixirs for the modern spirit, distilling xieyi's timeless\nwisdom—spontaneity as liberation, blank space as boundless mind—into visions\nthat soothe and inspire.

The traditional concept of\n\"working at sunrise and resting at sunset\" has been disrupted, and the\nboundaries between day and night are increasingly blurred. Many young people\neven actively extend their daytime hours to prove that they are not wasting\ntime. However, in contrast, the importance of nighttime management is being\noverlooked. As \"World Sleep Day\" arrives this year, the Chinese Sleep Research\nSociety has released the \"2025 China Sleep Health Survey Report\" (hereinafter\nreferred to as the \"Report\"). This report is regarded as China's first\nobjective, scientific, and authoritative statistical report on sleep health\ndata. According to the \"Report,\" the proportion of Chinese people aged 18 and\nabove who experience sleep problems is as high as 48.5%, which means that more\nthan 500 million people nationwide are suffering from various sleep problems\nsuch as nighttime urination, frequent awakenings or early awakenings, and\ndifficulty falling asleep.\n\nOf course, more and more people are now aware of their sleep problems and are\ntrying various ways to get a good night's sleep. The most direct approach may be\nto take an appropriate amount of sleeping pills; others worry about drug safety\nand turn to melatonin instead. In addition, a wide variety of sleep aids on the\nmarket have also come into view—from oral sleep gummies and pills to external\nsleep patches and aromatherapy, and so on. Among the dazzling array of sleep\naids and health products, one substance is often used: it does not have the\n\"powerful\" effect and obvious side effects of traditional sleeping pills such as\nestazolam and clonazepam, nor does it require a complex artificial synthesis\nprocess to obtain. It is a natural ingredient and is even commonly found in many\nteas we drink daily. Speaking of which, you might think we're going to talk\nabout theanine—but today we're focusing on GABA, or γ-aminobutyric acid.\n\n\nWhat is γ-aminobutyric acid?#\n\nγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA, where γ is a Greek letter, pronounced \"gamma\") is a\nnon-protein amino acid naturally present in animals, plants, and microorganisms.\nIt is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous\nsystem. GABA was first synthesized in the laboratory in 1883 and subsequently\ndiscovered in plants, microorganisms, and animals. It wasn't until 1950 that\nscientists discovered its high concentration in animal brain tissue and further\nconfirmed that it is a key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central\nnervous system. The concept of \"inhibitory neurotransmitter\" is very important\nand crucial to our understanding of GABA's physiological functions.\n\n\nHow does GABA work in the human body?#\n\nThe human nervous system is like a highly complex communication network that\nconnects the brain to the whole body, regulating our senses and emotions. In\nthis network, \"neurons\" are like messengers delivering signals, exchanging\ninformation through \"synapses,\" the connection points. And \"neurotransmitters\"\nare the \"signal letters\" carried by these messengers, determining whether the\ninformation continues to be transmitted with excitation or decelerated with\ninhibition. In the brain, GABA plays a key role as a \"calming messenger\" or\n\"cooling agent.\" When certain neurons are overexcited, causing anxiety or\ntension, GABA is released and precisely binds to specific receptors on the next\nneuron—this process is like inserting a \"calming instruction\" into a dedicated\nmailbox, which can effectively inhibit nerve excitation and block the\ntransmission of excessive signals, thereby helping the nervous system to restore\nbalance. It can be said that GABA is an indispensable \"braking system\" for\nmaintaining neural balance.\n\nInsomnia, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, and more are related to our\nnervous system. As an inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA can soothe our nerves\nwhen they are \"surging,\" so it has physiological functions including improving\nsleep, lowering blood pressure, relieving anxiety, and acting as an\nantidepressant, and most of these have been proven by clinical trials. For\nexample, regarding improving sleep, in a study published by Japanese scientists\nin 2016, 10 subjects aged 23 to 37 years (4 men and 6 women) took 100 ml of GABA\norally every day. After three weeks, the time it took them to fall asleep and\nenter deep sleep was effectively shortened, and the duration of their deep sleep\nwas extended.\n\nIn addition, the subjects' satisfaction with sleep also improved. This is due to\nGABA being a non-dependent neurotransmitter that can be quickly absorbed by the\nhuman body with very little residue. Another example is lowering blood pressure.\nA clinical trial of 50 men and women lasting 8 weeks showed that supplementing\nwith 80 mg of GABA daily can lower blood pressure in patients with mild\nhypertension. The mechanism is that GABA can bind to synaptic receptors that\npromote vasodilation, thereby helping blood vessels relax and achieve a blood\npressure-lowering effect.","routePath":"/blog/2025-12-31-GABA","lang":"en-US","toc":[{"text":"What is γ-aminobutyric acid?","id":"what-is-γ-aminobutyric-acid","depth":2,"charIndex":2112},{"text":"How does GABA work in the human body?","id":"how-does-gaba-work-in-the-human-body","depth":2,"charIndex":2845}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{"date":"2025-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"},"version":""},{"id":5,"title":"2025 New Tea Release","content":"#\n\nIn the coming days, I will be showcasing a variety of ancient tree teas that\nhave already arrived in Europe and are launching simultaneously worldwide.\nYou're warmly invited to explore our 2025 new releases, as well as our 2020\nvintage Puerh ancient tree tea collection—to truly appreciate the wonderful\ntransformations that time bestows upon these teas.

One wants you to “calm down” (soothe\nthe mind), the other wants you to “wake up” (stimulate), singing opposing tunes\nin the tea every day — aren't they just like a pair of “rivals”?\n\nMany people wonder which kind of Puerh tea has the least impact on sleep. The\nanswer is aged tea (including well-stored aged raw Puerh and fermented aged ripe\nPuerh). Why? Let's look at how this pair of “rivals” changes between new and\naged tea: L-Theanine content: new raw > aged raw > new ripe > aged ripe\n(decreases with age) Caffeine content: new raw > aged raw > new ripe > aged ripe\n(also decreases with age)\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, as the tea ages, both the calming L-theanine and the\nstimulating caffeine decrease. So in the end, which one wins — calming or\nstimulating? The truth is they work together as a team. The calming effect of\ntea is actually the combined result of L-theanine and caffeine; you can't look\nat just one of them. In new raw tea, especially tender bud tea, caffeine levels\nare particularly high, and its stimulating power completely overpowers the\ncalming effect of L-theanine, so drinking new raw tea is more likely to affect\nsleep. In aged raw tea, the stimulating effect is still slightly stronger than\nthe calming one, but the impact on sleep is usually quite small.\n\n\n\nFor ripe Puerh, especially aged ripe Puerh, a large amount of caffeine is broken\ndown and transformed through pile-fermentation or long-term storage. Although\nL-theanine decreases too, overall the stimulating effect is greatly weakened and\ngenerally does not affect sleep. These “rivals” are actually great partners.\nScientists have discovered that although they seem to “fight” on the surface,\nbehind the scenes they help each other out. L-theanine can “rein in” caffeine —\nwhen caffeine makes your heart beat faster or causes slight nervousness\n(palpitations), L-theanine steps in to ease those feelings. Together they can\nalso create an “optimal state”: when combined, they produce a feeling of being\n“alert yet peaceful” — the mind is clear, but without anxiety or restlessness.\nThis is why the stimulation from tea often feels gentler and less likely to\ncause heart palpitations than drinking pure coffee. L-theanine acts like a\n“natural sedative” in tea and is one of the secret weapons that makes tea known\nas a “healthy stimulant beverage.”\n\n\n\nL-theanine and caffeine may look like a pair of “rivals” who bicker every day,\nbut in reality they are “joyful rivals” who cannot do without each other.\nL-theanine skillfully neutralizes the tension caused by caffeine, making the\nstimulating effect more comfortable and peaceful. In the tea broth they “love\nand fight,” cooperating perfectly, ultimately working together to deliver just\nthe right amount of clear-headedness. This marvelous combination is precisely\nthe charm of Pu-erh tea.","routePath":"/blog/L-Theanine-and-Caffeine","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{"date":"2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z"},"version":""},{"id":8,"title":"A Collection of Latest Research Reports on the Health Benefits of Tea","content":"#\n\nWithin leaves that have traversed millennia lie the health codes deciphered by\nmodern science. Recent studies in top-tier journals like The Lancet and Nature\nreveal that a simple cup of tea offers far more than just refreshment and\nquenching thirst. From counteracting the body's aging clock and preserving brain\nvitality to regulating metabolic disorders caused by insomnia, and even\nprecisely \"orchestrating\" gut microbiota. This science popularization article\nwill guide you through the latest scientific evidence, uncovering the surprising\nhealth potential hidden in a cup of tea and how to smarter \"drink\" for health.\nOf course, science has its boundaries, and drinking tea requires wisdom; a\nrational perspective is essential to truly allow this timeless beverage to\ncontribute to our health.\n\n\n3 Cups of Tea Daily for Optimal Anti-Aging Effects#\n\nIn November 2023, a research team led by Zhao Xing and Xiao Xiong from West\nChina Hospital of Sichuan University published an original paper titled \"Tea\nconsumption and attenuation of biological aging\" in EClinicalMedicine, a\nsub-journal of The Lancet. This study, integrating long-term health data from\n7,938 adults aged 30-79 from the Chinese Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) and 5,998\nmiddle-aged and older adults aged 37-73 from the UK Biobank (UKB), employed\ninternationally recognized aging biomarkers (such as telomere length and\nepigenetic clocks) for quantitative assessment for the first time. It found that\nconsistent tea drinkers experienced a significantly slower rate of biological\naging. Those consuming about 3 cups of tea daily (equivalent to 6-8 grams of tea\nleaves) exhibited the strongest anti-aging effect, with their phenotypic age\nbeing on average 1.41 years (CMEC cohort) and 1.93 years (UKB cohort) younger\nthan their chronological age, alongside significantly lower key inflammatory\nmarkers. The team specifically noted that this effect was most pronounced among\ngreen and black tea drinkers.\n\n\nPu-erh Tea: The Gut Microbiota 'Conductor' Lowering the 'Three Highs'#\n\nIn October 2019, teams led by Jia Wei and Zhao Aihua from Shanghai Jiao Tong\nUniversity Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital and Li Houkai from Shanghai\nUniversity of Traditional Chinese Medicine published an article titled\n\"Theabrownin from Pu-erh tea attenuates hypercholesterolemia via modulation of\ngut microbiota and bile acid metabolism\" in Nature Communications. Through\nrigorous scientific experiments, they confirmed for the first time that\nlong-term consumption of Pu-erh tea indeed helps lower the 'three highs'\n(hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia) and improve obesity issues. This\nstudy conducted controlled trials on both mice and human volunteers: after four\nweeks of Pu-erh tea consumption by mice on a high-fat diet and human subjects,\nboth animals and humans showed significant reductions in cholesterol levels in\nblood and liver, and their weight was controlled.\n\nThe key discovery lies in the dark color of Pu-erh tea soup. During the\nfermentation process, Pu-erh tea produces a large amount of theabrownin (the\nmain reason for the tea soup's reddish-brown color). After entering the\nintestines, this substance precisely regulates the gut microbiota, particularly\ninhibiting certain bile salt-deconjugating bacteria. Theabrownin acts like a\n'conductor' for the gut microbiota, directing the body to convert harmful\ncholesterol into waste for excretion.\n\n\nDaily Tea Drinking Linked to 16% Lower Dementia Risk#\n\nOn September 26, 2022, a significant study titled \"Tea consumption and risk of\nincident dementia: a prospective cohort study of 365,682 participants\" was\npublished in Nature Aging, a sub-journal of the international top academic\njournal Nature. This study analyzed health data from over 370,000 participants\naged 50-74 in the UK Biobank, with a follow-up period of approximately 9 years.\nThe core conclusion was that compared to those who did not drink tea at all,\ndaily tea drinkers had a 16% lower overall risk of developing dementia. More\nimportantly, the study found a \"U-shaped\" relationship between the amount of tea\nconsumed and dementia risk, meaning the benefits of tea drinking are not \"the\nmore, the better.\" Drinking 1 to 6 cups of tea daily (about 250 ml per cup) was\neffective in reducing risk, with around 3 cups per day being optimal (risk\nreduction up to 25%-29%). The protective effect weakened when consumption\nexceeded 6 cups. The study also found that tea drinking might be more effective\nin preventing vascular dementia than Alzheimer's disease. Of course, the\nresearchers noted that this is an observational study, proving correlation\nrather than absolute causation, and the conclusions might be influenced by\nfactors like participant background. This study provides strong scientific\nevidence that tea drinking may benefit brain health.\n\n\nLong-Term Tea Drinking Helps Alleviate Metabolic Imbalance Caused by Chronic\nInsomnia#\n\nA team of Chinese scientists published a new study in Nature Communications,\nrevealing how long-term tea drinking helps alleviate imbalances in gut\nmicrobiota and bile acid metabolism caused by chronic insomnia, thereby reducing\nthe risk of metabolic diseases. This joint research by Westlake University, Sun\nYat-sen University, and Southern Medical University was based on two large\nChinese population cohorts – the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (over\n4,000 middle-aged and older adults) and the Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project\n(over 10,000 participants). It involved an average follow-up of 6.2 years and\nmulti-omics analysis.\n\nThe study found that chronic insomnia significantly reduced gut microbiota\ndiversity, decreased the abundance of key bacterial genera, led to increased\nprimary bile acid levels and decreased secondary bile acid levels. These changes\nmediated the association between insomnia and metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes\nvia the gut microbiota-bile acid axis. Importantly, long-term tea drinking\nhabits mitigated the adverse effects of insomnia on these indicators in both\nhealthy populations and those with chronic diseases, suggesting that tea\ndrinking may act as a protective mechanism helping to maintain gut and metabolic\nhealth. This study is the first to systematically elucidate the mechanism of tea\ndrinking in regulating insomnia-related metabolic issues.\n\n\nTea 'Snipes' Chronic Inflammation via Dual Pathways#\n\nBased on an authoritative review published in the top pharmacology journal\nPharmacology & Therapeutics in 2025 by a team led by Ying Jian from Wuhan\nPolytechnic University, tea has been confirmed to combat chronic metabolic\ninflammation through dual pathways: Core components like tea polyphenols and\ntheaflavins remodel the gut microbiota, potentially increasing probiotics like\nBifidobacterium and Akkermansia by 2.3 times, while reducing the risk of\nendotoxin entering the bloodstream. More importantly, tea promotes the\nproduction of short-chain fatty acids in the gut, activating protective\nreceptors and thereby strengthening intestinal barrier function. At the\nmolecular level, tea significantly alleviates mitochondrial damage-associated\nchronic inflammation by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome\nactivation, and modulating the Nrf2 pathway. Multiple clinical studies confirm\nthat this mechanism has clear effects on improving inflammatory markers in\nmetabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes. However, two practical factors\nmust be noted: Different tea types (green tea, black tea, etc.) have varying\nlevels and potencies of anti-inflammatory components due to differences in\nprocessing; individual differences in gut microbiota may cause fluctuations in\nintervention effects.\n\n\nThe Direct Anti-Cancer Mechanism of EGCG#\n\nOn February 13, 2021, a research team led by Professor Wang Chunyu from the\nDepartment of Biological Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute published\na research paper titled \"EGCG binds intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain\nof p53 and disrupts p53-MDM2 interaction\" in Nature Communications. It revealed\nfor the first time the direct anti-cancer mechanism of EGCG, a key component in\ngreen tea: EGCG acts like a 'molecular key,' precisely binding to a specific\nregion (the N-terminal domain) of the human tumor suppressor protein p53,\nblocking the 'destruction switch' (MDM2 protein) used by cancer cells to degrade\np53. This increases the stability of p53 in cancer cells by 1.8 times and its\nconcentration by 30%, thereby efficiently activating anti-cancer pathways (such\nas inducing cancer cell apoptosis). This discovery opens a new direction for\ndesigning anti-cancer drugs targeting p53 (traditional drugs could not target\nthis region). However, two major practical limitations exist: the EGCG\nconcentration used in the experiments far exceeds levels achievable through\ndaily tea consumption (human absorption rate of EGCG is less than 1%); and the\np53 protein is already mutated in about 50% of cancer patients, rendering this\nmechanism ineffective for them. Therefore, while the research holds significant\nvalue for drug development, one cannot directly conclude that \"drinking tea\nprevents cancer.\" A rational view of the relationship between tea drinking and\ncancer prevention is crucial.","routePath":"/blog/a-collection-of-the-latest-research-reports-on-tea-health","lang":"en-US","toc":[{"text":"3 Cups of Tea Daily for Optimal Anti-Aging Effects","id":"3-cups-of-tea-daily-for-optimal-anti-aging-effects","depth":3,"charIndex":803},{"text":"Pu-erh Tea: The Gut Microbiota 'Conductor' Lowering the 'Three Highs'","id":"pu-erh-tea-the-gut-microbiota-conductor-lowering-the-three-highs","depth":3,"charIndex":1971},{"text":"Daily Tea Drinking Linked to 16% Lower Dementia Risk","id":"daily-tea-drinking-linked-to-16-lower-dementia-risk","depth":3,"charIndex":3424},{"text":"Long-Term Tea Drinking Helps Alleviate Metabolic Imbalance Caused by Chronic Insomnia","id":"long-term-tea-drinking-helps-alleviate-metabolic-imbalance-caused-by-chronic-insomnia","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Tea 'Snipes' Chronic Inflammation via Dual Pathways","id":"tea-snipes-chronic-inflammation-via-dual-pathways","depth":3,"charIndex":6329},{"text":"The Direct Anti-Cancer Mechanism of EGCG","id":"the-direct-anti-cancer-mechanism-of-egcg","depth":3,"charIndex":7695}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{"published_at":"2025-10-17T08:00:00.000Z"},"version":""},{"id":9,"title":"The Gongdao Cup","content":"#\n\nThe Gongdao Cup, also known as the Fairness Cup, is similar to what is commonly\ncalled a tea pitcher or tea server.\n\nThe function of the Gongdao Cup is, simply put, to hold the brewed tea liquid,\npreventing the tea leaves from steeping for too long and becoming bitter. It\nalso serves the purpose of evaluation and even distribution of tea flavor.\n\nWhen brewing tea, it's inevitable that the tea isn't always drunk immediately.\nIf it continues to steep in the teapot, the tea liquid will become too strong\nand bitter.

In\nfact, this is not objective.\n\nThe large and thick leaves of Pu-erh tea are not necessarily related to whether\nit is ancient arbor tea, but rather to the tea variety. Tea trees have\nlarge-leaf and small-leaf varieties, as well as thick-leaf and thin-leaf types.\nYou cannot distinguish them solely based on appearance.\n\nThe \"Six Tastes and Two Natures Tea Identification Method\" identifies the tea's\ninternal qualities. As long as you choose a tea with internal qualities, you\nwill definitely choose ancient arbor tea, because only arbor-type ancient arbor\ntea can have rich internal qualities.\n\nThis method is divided into two parts:\n\n 1. The difference in tea tree growth methods and environment.\n 2. Using the performance of the taste to identify the inclusions of the tea.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. Aroma: One of the most important keys to identification. Ancient arbor tea\n    can obtain deep-soil mineral components and can embody the uniqueness of\n    each mountain top in the best state of rich internal quality, such as the\n    honey aroma and delicate, smooth soup of Yiwu, and the fruity, dense aroma\n    of Nannuo Mountain, with a perfect tea nature that combines strength and\n    softness. The choice of aroma should be a rich and lasting aroma, with a\n    unique aroma, and a stable aroma. The more stable the aroma, the more\n    internal quality, the older the tree.\n 2. Sweetness: This sweetness refers to the direct performance on the tongue\n    after entering the mouth. Do not confuse it with hui gan (returning\n    sweetness), but its sweetness is elegant and clear, often covered by the hui\n    gan. After drinking tea for a certain number of years, you can separate and\n    taste various flavors. New tea drinkers can hardly taste it. Sweetness is\n    also a good place to identify the quality of the tea, but it is not key.\n 3. Tea Soup: Tea soup is the second key to identifying the richness of internal\n    quality. Terrace tea has insufficient internal quality in the tea soup, so\n    it appears yellow-green. The tea soup is thin as water, and it will feel hot\n    in your mouth. You can try this carefully. Ancient arbor tea is full of\n    internal quality. With the same heat, the feeling of burning your mouth is\n    different.\n 4. Hui Gan (Returning Sweetness) and Salivation: Hui Gan and salivation are the\n    basic tastes of tea. Terrace tea shows hui gan and salivation relatively\n    quickly, but the persistence is poor, and it usually starts to weaken after\n    6 infusions. Ancient arbor tea is more stable and lasting.\n 5. Bitterness and Astringency: Bitterness and astringency are also key to\n    identifying the quality of tea. Bitterness and astringency are the nature of\n    tea, derived from catechins in the tea. They are necessary elements\n    contained in every tea. The different proportions of ingredients and\n    tea-making processes create different tea soup flavors, and the bitterness\n    and astringency of Pu-erh tea basically weaken or disappear after long-term\n    storage.\n 6. Throat Feel: Throat feel is also the third key to identifying the quality of\n    tea. The throat feel is a cool and comfortable feeling formed in the throat.\n    This feeling will make your breathing particularly smooth and comfortable,\n    and it will also form a feeling of hui gan and salivation in the throat, and\n    the aroma will last for a long time. Moreover, this charm will be brought\n    into the mouth with breathing. The longer the throat feel lasts, the more\n    internal quality there is.\n 7. Persistence: Simply put, it refers to the brew endurance of the tea. Brew\n    with boiling water, pour out the soup after 10 seconds for each brew. The\n    taste of the tea changes with the increase in the number of brews. Terrace\n    tea of Yunnan Pu-erh generally starts to weaken after 6 brews, while ancient\n    arbor tea of Pu-erh can last for more than 8-10 brews, and high-quality tea\n    can last for more than 12 brews.\n 8. Stability: The stability of the tea can be obtained through the\n    identification of persistence. The higher the stability of the tea, the more\n    it can prove that the internal quality content of the tea is particularly\n    rich. In the later stage of tea storage, the effect of later aging can be\n    stably obtained, and Pu-erh tea with excellent quality can be stored.\n\nThese methods are a comprehensive summary of the experience of the industry and\nmost people and are for reference only. After all, there are too many factors\nsuch as the variety, origin, and storage of Pu-erh tea, and there is no absolute\nstandard.","routePath":"/blog/how-to-identify-ancient-puerh-tee","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":11,"title":"Article","content":"#\n\n * GABA: γ- 氨基丁酸\n * 2025 New Tea Release\n * Wild Puerh Tea\n * L-Theanine and Caffeine: The “Joyful Rivals” in Puerh Tea\n * Puerh - soup feel\n * 2025 Ancient Tree Tea Tasting Event\n * A Collection of Latest Research Reports on the Health Benefits of Tea\n * The Gongdao Cup\n * How to Identify Ancient Arbor Pu-erh Tea?","routePath":"/blog/","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":12,"title":"Puerh - soup feel","content":"#\n\nWhen tasting Puerh tea, the most intuitive sensations are the flavors of the tea\nliquor—such as bitterness, astringency, and sweetness—followed perhaps by\nreturning sweetness and salivation, or the lingering aroma of the tea.\n\nThese are relatively direct feelings. However, the \"soup feel\" is often\noverlooked because it is so subtle. In Puerh tea appreciation, people frequently\ndiscuss【soup feel】. Let's chat with fellow tea enthusiasts about what soup feel\nis and how to perceive it.\n\nWhat is \"soup feel\"?\n\nThe simplest and clearest way to put it: It's the tactile sensation the tea\nliquor imparts to the mouth—the texture of the tea liquor itself, a feeling\nbrought about by the liquor. Generally speaking, soup feel encompasses:\nfull-bodied, thick, smooth, moist, mellow, delicate, pure, and fresh and\nrefreshing.\n\n\n\nFlavor: This falls under the realm of taste. After the tea liquor enters the\nmouth, it typically lingers for a certain period. During this time, we fully\nengage our taste organs to sense the tea's aroma, sweetness, bitterness,\nastringency, and returning sweetness. However, each person's sensitivity to tea\nflavors varies, so perceptions of flavor can differ slightly.\n\nMouthfeel: This is the combined sensation of soup feel and flavor, with the two\ncomplementing each other. It refers to the full-bodied, substantial, and\nharmonious sensation the tea liquor brings upon entering the mouth. This arises\nbecause the tea leaves are rich in internal substances, allowing various flavors\nin the liquor to blend harmoniously and deliver a unified sensation to the\npalate. When the fullness of the tea liquor reaches a certain level, it\ntransitions to the next stage: \"thickness\". Full-bodied → Thick → Heavy—these\nrepresent an ascending process of substance accumulation. Only by surpassing one\nthreshold can you reach the next. When the soup feel achieves heaviness, you'll\nexperience what people often call the 'tongue-pressing sensation.'Note that the\nfullness of the tea liquor is not the same as its concentration. Concentration\nrefers to the intensity of the tea's flavor, which is generally related to\nfactors like the amount of tea leaves, steeping time, and water temperature.\nIncreasing the amount of tea, using higher water temperature, or extending the\nsteeping time can make the liquor stronger, but this only boosts concentration\nwithout adding new flavors.\n\n\n\nCommon expressions: full-bodied, substantial, heavy, thick, etc. MoistThe tea\nliquor, upon entering the mouth and throat, brings a warm, jade-like moist\ncomfort.\n\nCommon expressions: soft and moist, oily and moist, finely moist, lubricated,\netc. SmoothThis refers to the tea liquor entering smoothly and silkily, delicate\nyet full-bodied, like threads of silk. It is a shared characteristic of Puerh\nripe tea and raw teas that have aged for many years. For Puerh teas (both raw\nand ripe) stored under optimal conditions, the degree of smoothness will enhance\nwith the length of aging.\n\n\n\nCommon expressions: smooth and fluid, thickly smooth, softly smooth, lubricated,\nglutinously smooth, etc. MellowConcentrated yet not harsh—this is mellowness.\nThe tea liquor is full and rich, but warm and agreeable to the palate, achieving\njust the right balance. It appears more frequently in aged raw teas and ripe\nteas. The mellowness of soup feel is related to the sugar-based substances in\nthe tea's internal components.Compared to other tea types, Puerh tea contains\nmore water-soluble sugars and free proteins. Especially after long-term storage,\nthe large-molecule polysaccharides and proteins that were originally difficult\nto dissolve in the liquor break down into easily soluble free polysaccharides,\noligosaccharides, and the like—this is a key reason why aged teas become so\nmellow. During the fermentation process of ripe Puerh, microorganisms convert\ninsoluble hemicellulose, cellulose, and starches into soluble sugars, making the\nripe tea liquor even more mellow and smooth.\n\nDelicateThe tea liquor imparts a sensation upon entering that is as soft and\nsilky as fine silk.\n\nPure The mouthfeel is clean and transparent, especially in teas from superior\necological environments, where it's easier to perceive a 'transparent\nsensation.'\n\n\n\nFresh and Refreshing: Freshness and refreshment refer to the lively, vibrant,\nand pleasurable drinking experience the tea liquor brings upon entering—clear,\nspirited, and invigorating. This is generally more prominent in young raw Puerh\nteas. \"Freshness and refreshment\" primarily stem from substances like amino\nacids, catechins, flavanols, and soluble sugars. For example, top-grade Yiwu\nforest tea: When the liquor contacts the tongue, it feels as soft as cotton and\nas sweet and limpid as a spring. Yet it is far from a thin sensation—instead,\nit's a full-bodied gentleness enveloping rich internal substances, even carrying\na honey-like glutinous thickness. Its pure soup feel comes with an inherent\ncooling purity, like the crisp delicacy of high-mountain snow melting. Another\nexample, \"Mint Pond\": The tea liquor exhibits an exceptionally high degree of\npurity, with a sweet and crystalline clarity reminiscent of high-mountain snow\nmelt.\n\nScraping Wind Village ancient tree spring tea liquor A tea that excels\nsimultaneously in full-bodied, moist, smooth, delicate, and pure qualities is\nundoubtedly a rare gem. Of course, more often, a tea may shine particularly in\njust a few of these aspects, and that's still worth savoring.\n\nThe joy of drinking tea can be holistic or spotlighted in a single standout\nfeature—but either way, it requires personal experience to truly appreciate.","routePath":"/blog/puerh-soup-feel","lang":"en-US","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{"date":"2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z"},"version":""},{"id":13,"title":"Wild Puerh","content":"#\n\nMy small Yixing whispers, the gongbei laughs—two breaths of boiling water, and\nonly then does it brim with sunrise.I carry the amber to my desk, where code\nflickers like restless ghosts.
