This study analyzed health data from over 370,000 participants aged 50-74 in the UK Biobank, with a follow-up period of approximately 9 years. The core conclusion was that compared to those who did not drink tea at all, daily tea drinkers had a 16% lower overall risk of developing dementia. More importantly, the study found a "U-shaped" relationship between the amount of tea consumed and dementia risk, meaning the benefits of tea drinking are not "the more, the better." Drinking 1 to 6 cups of tea daily (about 250 ml per cup) was effective in reducing risk, with around 3 cups per day being optimal (risk reduction up to 25%-29%). The protective effect weakened when consumption exceeded 6 cups. The study also found that tea drinking might be more effective in preventing vascular dementia than Alzheimer\'s disease. Of course, the researchers noted that this is an observational study, proving correlation rather than absolute causation, and the conclusions might be influenced by factors like participant background.

Multiple clinical studies confirm that this mechanism has clear effects on improving inflammatory markers in metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes.

It revealed for the first time the direct anti-cancer mechanism of EGCG, a key component in green tea: EGCG acts like a 'molecular key,' precisely binding to a specific region (the N-terminal domain) of the human tumor suppressor protein p53, blocking the 'destruction switch' (MDM2 protein) used by cancer cells to degrade p53. This increases the stability of p53 in cancer cells by 1.8 times and its concentration by 30%, thereby efficiently activating anti-cancer pathways (such as inducing cancer cell apoptosis). This discovery opens a new direction for designing anti-cancer drugs targeting p53 (traditional drugs could not target this region). However, two major practical limitations exist: the EGCG concentration used in the experiments far exceeds levels achievable through daily tea consumption (human absorption rate of EGCG is less than 1%); and the p53 protein is already mutated in about 50% of cancer patients, rendering this mechanism ineffective for them.
